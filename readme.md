https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

Consider the following operation on any arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.

That smallest i such that ai = 1 is called the total stopping time of n. The conjecture asserts that every n has a well
defined total stopping time. If, for some n, such an i doesn't exist, we say that n has infinite total stopping time and the
conjecture is false.

If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number which gives rise to a sequence that does not
contain 1. Such a sequence would either enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound. No such sequence
has been found.
